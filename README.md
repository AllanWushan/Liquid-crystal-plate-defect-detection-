# Liquid-crystal-plate-defect-detection-
apply OPENCV to detection the defect of Liquid crystal plate and make it visual by the Liquid crystal plate image. 
This project is aimed at the research and development of Liquid crystal panel defect detection,
in order to use visual technology to quickly and accurately detect the Liquid 
crystal panel defects on the production line, thus as to improve the production efficiency, 
which has a practical prospect. We use the combination of hardware industrial cameras and OPENCV, 
using the powerful OPENCV vision technology for visual recognition and detection
